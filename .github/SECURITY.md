# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We support the latest release of Gatenet. Please ensure you are using the most recent version before reporting security issues.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- **Public Reporting (Preferred):**

  - Please report security vulnerabilities, bugs, or issues by opening a GitHub Issue or Pull Request in this repository. This project is open source, and transparency is encouraged for most issues.
  - Public reporting helps the community review, discuss, and address issues collaboratively.

- **Private Reporting (Rare, Sensitive Cases Only):**
  - If your report involves law breaking, privacy concerns, or other highly sensitive matters, you may contact the maintainer privately at [contact@mjanglin.com](mailto:contact@mjanglin.com).
  - Only use private reporting for issues that cannot be disclosed publicly and require the maintainer's direct attention.

## Disclosure Policy

- Most security issues will be discussed and resolved publicly via GitHub Issues or Pull Requests.
- For sensitive issues reported privately, the maintainer will coordinate a fix and may request additional details.
- Once resolved, a public disclosure and fix will be made in the repository.

## General Guidelines

- Do not use security issues to report non-security bugs or feature requests; use standard GitHub Issues for those.
- Please provide as much detail as possible to help reproduce and address the issue.
- Respect the project's Code of Conduct when reporting and discussing vulnerabilities.

Thank you for helping keep Gatenet and its users safe!
