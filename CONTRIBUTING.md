## Coding Standards

- Follow the [Gatenet Copilot Instructions](.github/copilot-instructions.md).
- Use method chaining where appropriate for fluent APIs.
- Use abstract base classes (ABC) for extensible interfaces.
- Use the strategy and chain-of-responsibility patterns for service discovery and similar extensible features.
- When returning JSON from HTTP routes, return a Python `dict` (not serialized JSON).
- Include type hints and docstrings for all public functions and classes.

---

## Testing

- Use `pytest` and `assert` for all tests.
- Place tests in the appropriate subdirectory under `src/tests/`.
- Use `get_free_port()` from `gatenet.utils.net` to avoid port conflicts in tests.
- Use `pytest.mark.asyncio` for async tests.
- Mock network connections with `unittest.mock` or `pytest` fixtures.
- Test both positive and negative cases, including edge cases (timeouts, empty responses, case sensitivity).
